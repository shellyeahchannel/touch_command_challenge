#Requirements

Bash shell installed

#Instructions 

This is a mini terminal game so you can practice mostly with the touch command.

Download the zip file touch_challenge.zip and extract the contents on your PC(unzip touch_challenge.zip). 
Open the terminal, navigate inside the directories, list the contents on each directory 
and when ready open the file "ask_the_penguin_fellow" for instructions.

When you believe that you have fullfilled the mision's tasks, execute the file "reveal_the_secret_phrase".

To play this game you have to be familiar with cd, pwd, ls and touch commands.
You can watch the YouTube tutorial videos of each command, on shell.yeah.channel.
