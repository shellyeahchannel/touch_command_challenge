# Summary

This is a mini terminal game so you can practice with shell commands, mostly with the touch command.

# Requirements

• bash shell installed

• unzip installed

# Instructions

• Download the zip file touch_challenge.zip and extract the contents on a seperate folder under /tmp on your PC.
mkdir /tmp/challenge

mv touch_challenge.zip /tmp/challenge

• The zip file is password-protected, and the passphrase is revealed in a pop-up message during the video https://youtu.be/ywE4AjTTvCk

• Open the terminal, navigate inside the directories, list the contents of each directory, and when ready "ask_the_fellow_penguin" for instructions, with "cat ask_the_fellow_penguin"

• When you believe that you have fullfilled the mision's tasks, execute the file "reveal_the_secret_phrase".
